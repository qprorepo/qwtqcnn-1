The field of machine learning (ML) has been transformed by the advent of quantum processing technology. In order to address the issues that currently exist with regard to image classification, this work presents a novel approach of quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN). The system has been applied to MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets comprising 28×28 pixel-sized images, which may prove useful in high-resolution quantum convolution (QuC) processing. Similarly, the Pepper and medical images of Liver, with an image size of 512×512, were examined. Three performance parameters are systematically compared and contrasted with our QCNN. These are accuracy, training time and inference speed. Furthermore, the QCNN operates with a significant efficiently real-time inference time, attaining as low as 5 ms for 96.67% on MNIST. Furthermore, the implementation of data was achieved through the combinatorial effect with quantum wavelet transform (QWT) and quantum operations, including quantum pooling, depthwise separable convolutions, and simulated quantum entanglement. The results demonstrate that in settings requiring high accuracy and efficiency, the QCNN consistently exhibits more effective performance compared to its conventional counterparts. A variety of QuC algorithms were tested (click the data availability link to learn more), and simulation platforms including IBM Quantum Experience, and Google Cirq were also employed. These environments were selected for their distinctive resource capabilities, including the capacity to support up to 65 qubits and the capability to mitigate errors. Despite exhibiting more effective generalisation across numerous datasets, the model has demonstrated more effective performance relative to other models, achieving an accuracy of 99% on MNIST and 82% on FashionMNIST, due to its quantum properties. The results of the image processing on the Pepper and Liver images are provided in the supplementary material.
